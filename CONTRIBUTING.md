- Support both light and dark themes

### Code Quality

- Run linting before committing:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Payload CMS

- Follow Payload's collection and field conventions
- Use hooks appropriately (beforeChange, afterChange, etc.)
